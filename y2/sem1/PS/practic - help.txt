confidence intervals:
- alpha = 1 - confidence level
- miu = population mean (to be found)
- x = vector of data
- n = length of x (sample size)
- x cu bara deasupra = sample mean ( mean(x) )
- sigma^2 = population variance (to be found)
- s^2 (!= sigma^2) = sample variance ( var(x) )
- sigma = population standard deviation (to be found)
- s = sample standard deviation ( std(x) )
- z = quantiles

1. get x/n/alpha/sigma (depending pn the case)
2. find "x cu bara deasupra"/s/s^2
3. find the quantiles depending on the case from conf_int
4. find the interval for the mean/variance
5. (depending on the case)
   find the interval for the standard deviation
   = sqrt(the interval for the variance)


significance level:
- h0 = null hypothesis = previous experience
- h1 = alternate hypothesis = future/alternative experience
- alpha = significance level {0.05, 0.01, 0.1}
- TS = test statistic
- TS0 = observed value of the test statistic
- RR = rejection region
- P-value = minimum threshold of the rejection 
(smallest alpha for which we still reject h0)

- ztest = N law
- ttest = T law
- vartest = estimate sigma^2
- vartest2 = for ration of two populations (sigma1^2/sigma2^2)
- ztest2 or ttest2 = for miu1 - miu2 (depending on the law)

*
ztest(x, miu0, sigma, NAME, VALUE)
NAME = {"alpha", "tail"}
VALUE = {"left", "right", "both"}
*

1. [h, p, ci, z, zcrit] = ztest(x, miu0, sigma, "alpha", alpha, "tail", "left") (test might differ)
2. z2 = norminv(alpha or whatever the param is) (or tinv, finv, chi2inv)
3. find the rejection region
4. the if concerning the hypothesis
if h == 1 - the null hypothesis is rejected
else      - the null hypothesis is not rejected

5. print the rejection region (RR)/value of the statistic (z = TS0)/p-value (p) - from the test
