        <h3>Why books are actually good for you</h3>
        <p>Reading books benefits both your physical and mental health, and those benefits can last a lifetime. They begin in early childhood and continue through the senior years. <br>
Plus, reading has been shown to help us better understand and interact with other people, keep our brains sharp, expand our world views and grow as individuals,Melanie Green<b>[1]</b> says. “Stories allow us to feel connected with others and part of something bigger than ourselves.”<br>
Reading is a great way to exercise our brains to make us smarter and sharper. However, the knock-on effect of this is that reading also helps prevent age-related cognitive decline.<br>
Reading is good for you because it improves your focus, memory, empathy, and communication skills. It can reduce stress, improve your mental health, and help you live longer. Reading also allows you to learn new things to help you succeed in your work and relationships.

        <h3>Some alternative mediums</h3>
        <p>Audiobooks are voice recordings of the text of a book that you listen to rather than read. Audiobooks can be exact word-for-word versions of books or abridged versions.<br>
Here is an example of "A Dream Within a Dream" by Edgar Allen Poe</p>
        <audio controls>
          <source src="A Dream Within a Dream" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>An e-book or electronic book is a non-editable text that is converted into a digital format and displayed and read on an electronic device, such as a tablet or smartphone.<br>
Here is a video explaining in more detail</p>
