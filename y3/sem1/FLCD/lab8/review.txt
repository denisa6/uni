Code review for Diana Jugariu + Ioana Claudia Moisiuc considering that I have no clue who wrote what part of the code.

I can't find a single mistake, the code is absolutely perfect. The algorithm that they had to implement was 10 times more difficult than what I had to do. I can't understand how they pulled it off so well.
The overall code is very well-structured, and I'm glad that they stuck to only one naming convention for the variables/function names. :)
In conclusion: amazing.
